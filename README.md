# Snake_AI_Using_Neat

The classic snake game coded using PyGame being applied to the neat algorithm to progressively train an AI.

Run the Snake.py file to watch the AI train or run with the 'User' argument (python Snake.py User) to play a regular game of snake with user input.

## Files
Snake.py -> Contains all the code for the game and interaction with neat

config-feedforward.txt -> Configuration file for the neat algorithm

## User Input

### User Mode
In 'User' mode the arrow keys are used to control the snake. The 'User' mode has a fixed clock speed.

### Training Mode
In the training mode you can use the up and down arrow keys to control the clock speed of the training. You can also hit spacebar to kill of the remaining snakes in a generation if they are stuck in a cycle. The program will automatically kill of these Snakes after some time but you can use the spacebar input if it is taking too long.
